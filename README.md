# PHP Projects Repository

This repository contains four PHP projects developed as part of my learning journey. Each project focuses on different aspects of PHP programmingâ€”from basic server information display to dynamic form handling and data manipulation and CRUD operations.

## Projects

- **[Project 1: PHP 1st Lab](./php_first_lab/index.php)**  
  *Overview:*  
  Demonstrates basic PHP functionalities such as defining constants, displaying server details (server name, IP address, port, current file, and directory), and using control structures with a switch statement.

- **[Project 2: PHP Functions & Arrays Lab](./php_second_lab/index.php)**  
  *Overview:*  
  Explores core PHP functions including:
  - Handling newline characters with `nl2br()`
  - Displaying the `$_SERVER` variable in a readable format
  - Working with string and array functions (e.g., `strlen()`, `strtolower()`, `sort()`)
  - Calculating the sum and average of an array and sorting it in reverse order
  - Sorting an associative array in ascending and descending order by key and value

- **[Project 3: PHP Class Registration Application](./php_third_lab/)**  
  *Overview:*  
  Comprises two tasks:
  1. **Student Data Display:**  
     Displays a list of students in an HTML table with conditional formatting (highlighting rows in red for students on the CMS track).
  2. **Registration Form:**  
     Implements a form with input validation (name, email, gender, selected courses, and agreement checkbox) and error handling, then outputs the submitted data.

- **[Project 4: Comprehensive CRUD Application](./php_fourth_lab/index.php)**  
  *Overview:*  
  This is a full-featured web application that implements all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using the POST method. It is built with PHP and styled with Bootstrap to ensure a modern, responsive frontend. The project is divided into multiple files for handling different operations such as user registration, data insertion, updates, deletion, and data retrieval.

  **Key Features:**  
  - **CRUD Operations:**  
    Implements complete CRUD functionality across multiple PHP scripts.
  - **Frontend Integration:**  
    Uses Bootstrap for a modern look and feel, ensuring mobile responsiveness.
  - **Error Handling:**  
    Validates form data and displays error messages for issues like invalid email formats or missing data.
